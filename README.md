# console-chess

Command line chess games. 

In it's current guise, it is basically a digital chessboard. Nothing more.

**NOT YET COMPLETE**

The good:
* Play chess on the console

The bad:
* No AI
* No rules enforcement. You must keep yourself within the rules
* No Auto Check/Checkmate. You must call it yourself

The ugly:
* This code, it's my first C project beyond 150 lines of code.
